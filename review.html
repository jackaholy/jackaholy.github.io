<h1><u>Hosts Review</u></h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>GoDaddy is a great choice as you can create the biggest, or smallest sites
      with this host.</li>

  <li>GoDaddy is the global leader in domains offering more than 84 million domains.</li>
  <li>Domains can be as cheap as a penny, and steadily increase depending on what
    you're looking for.</li>
  <li>GoDaddy offers the lowest prices on the internet when choosing a provider,
      which makes it the perfect host for new businesses or company's that are

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://fatcow.com/">Fatcow.com</a></h2>

<h2><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>HostGator is yet another popular web hosting service that "scales from easy
    to expert".</li>
  <li>Starting at only $2.75/month you can get started quickly and get free domain
      for a year.</li>
  <li>HostGator currently hosts over 2 million websites which proves its security.</li>
  <li>Mainstream domains such as ".com" ".net" and ".org" start at $12.95/year,
      however others can be as cheap as $0.95/year.</li>
  <li>HostGator offers a variety of web hosting plans including shared hosting,
      website building, WordPress hosting, and VPS hosting.</li>
</ul>

<p>After reviewing three different web hosts I believe that GoDaddy is the best
    option. It comes at an affordable price, and is easy to use. For a new
    business that is starting out, or a preexisting one, GoDaddy offers a variety
    of domains, and is widly used.</p>
