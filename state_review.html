    <h1><u>Review of State Websites</u></h1>
      <ol>
        <h2><li><a href="https://www.illinois.gov">Illinois.gov</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Illinois.gov went all out on their website. Right after opening their page I was greeted by a vitual assistant. I was successfully able to navigate through it and learn about vaccine mandates and other important info in Illinois.</li>
          <li>The home page is aesthetically pleasing and I actually feel inclined to keep scrolling to see what else the page offers.</li>
          <li>The page will fit to differnt window sizes in a mostly clean way, which is nice for those using the website on differnt types of devices.</li>
          <li>The color choices are pretty bland and this website could definitely use a bit more "pizzazz". I can look past this though thanks to the organization and loading speed of the website.</li>
          <li>This is my favorite website out of the five state sites because it is very welcoming and actually makes me want to use it.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2><li><a href="https://www.myflorida.com">Myflorida.com</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The background picture takes a bit to load, however I like that the photo changes everytime you reload the page. It adds a much needed spice to Florida's website.</li>
          <li>This website is simple and to the point. In fact there is so little on this site that you can't get lost even if you try. The only options are to contact them or type in a question which will redirect you to <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google<a>.</li>
          <li>An issue about this page is when trying to minimize the window, it does not look the best and can't fit to different sizes cleanly.</li>
          <li>Hands down my favorite part of this website is the "Great Seal of the State of Florida" in the top left corner of the page. It makes me happy.</li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><li><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">Nebraska.gov</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Seeing the twitter tweets from @Nebraskagov posted on the first page I wanted to cringe, but optimistic I powered through to check out the rest of the site.</li>
          <li>Nebraska.gov had a surprisingly detailed drop down menu, and I like that you can see all of the diffent links and lists right away. The one thing I really disliked about this site is that in order to optain any solid information you were required to visit a linked site.</li>
          <li>This website obviously didn't feel too creative with their colors because they stuck to a boring grey and blue color scheme. </li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><li><a href="https://delaware.gov">Delaware.gov</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Delaware.gov has a similar issue to Alaska's website; there is a lack of color and being on this website makes me feel depressed. However, unlike Alaska, Delaware's website feels professionally made. As you scroll down, text, images, and lists fade into the screen.</li>
          <li>In the "Guides" section of the website the words <b>"ASK US"</b> have such a large font size that it feels like it's screaming at me. At least it will be hard to miss.</li>
          <li>Delaware.gov puts such an emphasis on COVID-19 in their home page that most people probably feel drawn away. This is because nobody is coming to this website to learn about COVID-19. People will go elsewhere to learn about that.</li>
          <li>This website is fine, but nothing more than that. It's just "okay".</li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><li><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska.gov</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Moments after opening this website I was drawn away. I wanted to click the "back" arrow, yet, I needed to further examine the blandness of it.</li>
          <li>I shouldn't be too surprised that the most seculded state has the most boring website. I can't imagine much goes on in Alaska anyways, however they pulled themselves together and managed to create an outdated page.</li>
          <li>Alaska.gov is lacking on color, news, and just about every other aspect. It seems to me like the most exciting thing going on there is the pandemic (not too exciting considering this is happening across the globe).</li>
          <li>I do not see myself, or others, going to this webisite too often because I have no reason to, however it is user friendly and easy enough to navigate.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately it looks like Alaska.gov threw as many lists and links as possible into this website, thus the amount of info feels overwelming.</li>
          <li>This is my least favorite website because of the dreariness and depressing vibes that it holds.</li>
          </li>
