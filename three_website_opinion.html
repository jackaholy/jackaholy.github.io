    <h1><u>Three Website Opinion</u></h1>

    <h2><strong><u>Good Websites:</u></strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia.org</a> is one of the most widely known sites on the internet and contains information about just about every event in history. I like this website because of how versatile it is, especially for beginner research and quick searches. Wikipedia stands out from other websites because of how many different uses it has, and how much information is stored on it. Wikipedia is not just made for some, but instead for all. The code for the main page of wikipedia is generally clean and easy to read, and it is up-to-date using HTML5. There is a scrolling effect to the page and it is easy to navigate through and find the information you need. There are few colors used on wikipedia pages. With the exception of a blue font color used for a few labels, it is all in black and white. A smaller detail that I like about this website is the margin spacing. It feels very smooth and with clean cut corners.</p>
    <p>Home to over 800 million videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com</a> is one of the most used websites on the internet. Similarly to wikipedia you can access a whole host of information on just about anything. The website is very aesthetically pleasing and has an intentional addicting factor to it (YouTube will suggest videos based on your interests). This site uses HTML5 and is constantly up to date. The code is organized, but there is so much information in it that it is hard to tell what is what. However, I could identify the larger pieces of this site within the code without too much trouble. YouTube is very user friendly which makes it easy to navigate around the site and get to where you need to go. YouTube includes a side menu as well as a search bar which gives the user many options on what they want to do.</p>

    <h2><strong><u>Bad Website:</u></strong></h2>
    <p>Although some might see it as a hilarious joke, <a href="http://www.ismycomputeron.com/">ismycomputeron.com</a> is just about the most useless and simple website that can be created. I feel as though it is unfair of me to dislike this website, because how can I dislike a site that does not have anything there? This website was not created for any purpose besides being a site that informs the user if their computer is on or not. Digging deeper into the code I found no surprises. Half of all of the html code is fit into a single line. A website so basic cannot serve any legitimate purpose, but to some the simplicity and humor of it may be appealing. The website is very easy to navigate, the layout makes sense, and it is so short that there is no need to scroll. In addition, the color usage is effective and simple; black and white.</p>
